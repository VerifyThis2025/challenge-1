This is the first challenge for the VerifyThis 2025 competition. Please see the file [challenge-1.pdf](challenge-1.pdf) for the problem description and list of tasks.

### Getting your copy of the challenge repository

Before you perform the next steps, you first need to create your own
private copy of the template repository for this challenge. 

To do so, click on the link provided in the announcement of the challenge.

After clicking on the link, select the name of your team to join it or
if your team does not yet exist, create a new team with the name of
your team. If you have a team member, please coordinate with them to
make sure that you join the right team. At most two people can be on
the same team.

After accepting the assignment, a copy of the repository will be created. It will be
available at
`https://github.com/VerifyThis2025/challenge-1-<YOUR-TEAM-NAME>`
where <YOUR-TEAM-NAME> is your team's name in all lower case letters.

* Open a browser at `https://github.com/VerifyThis2025/challenge-1-<YOUR-TEAM-NAME>`.
* Choose a place on your computer for your homework assignments to reside and open a terminal to that location.
* Execute the following git command: <br/>
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/VerifyThis2025/challenge-1-<YOUR-TEAM-NAME>.git challenge-1
  cd challenge-1
  ```
  You may of course use any Git client of your choice as an alternative.
